        <p class="major">A web3 startup for decentralized peer-review.
</p>
        <p>The current system of academic publishing has severe downsides, which negatively impact the quality of research
and exploit public funds as well as human resources in the form of peer-reviewers.
We propose a <strong>decentralized, self-governed peer-review network</strong> to move from worries about impact
factors towards high quality research and fair treatment of scientists.

        <h2>The status quo</h2>
        <p>Citations and impact factors are the metrics in which to measure scientific reputation.
Researchers depend on the system of academic publishing in order to gain visibility and secure funding or positions.
However, the process of academic publishing, especially the peer-review process is far from optimal.
It does not incentivize high-quality peer-review due to confidential and sole pre-publication review, missing remuneration
and an overload of publication that are to be reviewed.
On top, the publishers established models of double or even triple dipping to access works that the scientific community themselves
produced and reviewed.
We believe that we can do much better than the current system of academic publishing.

        <h2>Towards DeSci</h2>
        <p>Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement in analogy to decentralized
finance (DeFi), which aims at utilizing web3 technology in order to move
away from the centralized structures in academic publishing towards
self-governed research communities. This idea suggests itself, since
researchers already take on many crucial roles in academic publishing;
review serves as the most prominent example. Hence, with the right tools,
the scientific community might be able to overcome many of the problems
of the current system and improve the overall quality of science.

        <h2>Reclaim your Science</h2>
        <p>The peer-review process is the most crucial - and maybe vulnerable - part
of academic publishing. Currently, peer-review is not incentivized. researchers
are neither renumerated for good nor penalized for bad reviews. Reviews are
kept confidential and mechanisms of reviewer assignment are totally intransparent.
We develop a sytem that incentivizes high-quality review by remunerating researchers
for their work, making the review process double blind, publish the reviews
together with the original work and add a full-flexed reputation system that
allows to track the quality of reviews and reviewers.
