        <p class="major">A web3 startup for decentralized peer-review.
</p>
        <p>The current system of academic publishing negatively impacts the quality
of research and exploits public funds as well as human resources.
We propose a <strong>decentralized, self-governed peer-review network</strong>
to incentivize highest quality research and fair treatment of scientists.

        <h2>The status quo</h2>
        <p>Citations and impact factors are the metrics by which to measure scientific reputation.
Researchers depend on the system of academic publishing in order to gain visibility and secure funding or positions.
However, the process of academic publishing, especially the peer-review process is far from optimal.
It does not incentivize high-quality peer-review due to confidential and sole pre-publication review, missing remuneration
and an overload of publication that are to be reviewed.
On top, the journals established models of double or even triple dipping to
publish or access works that the scientific community themselves produced and reviewed.
We believe that we can do much better than the current system.

        <h2>Towards DeSci</h2>
        <p>Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement in analogy to decentralized
finance (DeFi), which aims at utilizing web3 technology in order to move
away from the centralized structures in academic publishing towards
self-owned self-governed research communities. Researchers already take on
many crucial roles in academic publishing; review serves as the most prominent
example. Hence, with the right tools, the scientific community can overcome
many of the problems of the current system and improve the
overall quality of science.

        <h2>Reclaim your Science</h2>
        <p>The peer-review process is the most crucial - and maybe vulnerable - part
of academic publishing. Currently, peer-review is not incentivized. Researchers
are neither renumerated for good nor penalized for bad reviews. Reviews are
usually confidential and the mechanism of reviewer assignment is laborious
and intransparent. We are developing a system that makes scientists volunteer
for creating high-effort reviews by 1) remunerating them for their efforts
and 2) publishing the (anonymized) reviews for scrutiny by the community,
all driven by a full-fledged reputation system, digital certificates,
stablecoin payments and empowered by transparent smart-contract
blockchain technology.
